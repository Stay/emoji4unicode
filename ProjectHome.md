Google uses Private Use mappings to represent Emoji ("picture character") symbols in Unicode text. These characters are commonly used by Japanese cell phone carriers. This project makes these mappings available.

Google and other members of the Unicode consortium are also developing a proposal for the addition of standardized Emoji symbol characters to Unicode. This project also provides data and tools that can be used in the development of the proposal. The tools are Python scripts that provide for consistency checks, reports on the data, and chart generation.

The project documentation is available at http://sites.google.com/site/unicodesymbols/Home/emoji-symbols and its subpages.

We will create repository tags for stable project code and data snapshots. The repository trunk contains the development version.

Generated HTML charts are available at http://www.unicode.org/~scherer/emoji4unicode/
